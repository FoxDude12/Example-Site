    <h2 id="PageHeader">Citing information online</h2>
    <p id="PageBody">Now the most important part of information gathering online is making sure to properly cite your sources. Plagarism
      is something that is generally frowned upon, especially in academic circles. However, many sites may not even display all of the
      information you need anywhere. As such, here are some quick essentials for what you need when citing a source online</p>
    <ul id="Pagelist">
        <li>URL: letting people check up on your source is essential for this to work.
        <li>Date published/updated: you can get away not having the month or day but the year let's people know that your information is
          up to date.
        <li>Date Accessed: since websites can be changed easily, it is important to let the teacher know which version you are using
        <li>Author/Site manager: Sometimes their might not be a specific author for a page, so to still give proper credit, you give the
          name of whatever entity runs the site.
    </ul>

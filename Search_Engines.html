    <h2 id="PageHeader">Search Engines and You</h2>
    <p id="PageBody">The important thing to remember about search engines is that they don't actually think. That is to say, if you enter
        the sentence "How do birds fly?" the search engine does not search through the internet for an answer like you would your brain.
        Instead, what the engine does is look through the internet for web pages containing some variant of "How do birds fly?" whether
        it be the full sentence or the individual words. Thus, to get the most out of your engine, you need tomake sure your wording is
        as precise as possible, otherwise you will just get a bunch of junk results.</p>
    <p id="PageBody">Of course, their are methods to make your search more precise like putting you search in quotation marks so as to
      only look for that specific sentence</p>
    <p id="PageBody">Still, so long as you think about what you write, it shouldn't be to difficult to find what you want.</p>
    <p id="PageBody">Some example engines include:</p>
    <ul id="PageBody">
      <li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a>
      <li><a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>
      <li><a href="http://ask.com">Ask</a>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="PageHeader">Exploring a Site</h2>
    <p id="PageBody">Sometimes, what you are looking for might not be readily available on the page that you end up on. Rather then go
      back to your search engine it pays to be able to explore the site a little.</p>
    <p class="PageBody">The most obvious way to do this is to scroll around with your scroll bars on the right or bottom. (or with your
      finger on IOS). After this you should look for any information or items on the page that stand out. Most site creators know how to
      make certain parts of their pages much more noticeable when they need to. Finally, look for any links that lead either to the home
      page or towards something that sounds useful to your current endeavors. That's it, not to complicated eh?</p>

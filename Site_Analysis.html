    <h2 id="PageHeader">Telling Good Sites from Bad</h2>
    <p id="PageBody">As anyone that has spent significant time on the internet knows, scams and misinformation are everywhere. As such
      it is necessary to make sure that the information you find is accurate. Here is a list of things to look for when attempting to do
      this.</p>
    <ul id="PageBody">
      <li>Try and avoid .com's in favor of .edu's and .gov's. the latter sites have a level of oversite you will rarely see for .com's.
      <li>While sites that update regularly are good, it is important to make sure those updates aren't to often or unmodderated, least
        some falsehood slip through (this is why you shouldn't use wikipedia)
      <li>Pay attention to any imagery or word choice that may indicate bias in the source, the last thing you need is to get your
        information tainted with a political bent
      <li>Finally, make sure the most recent update isn't to old, otherwise your information may be out of date.
